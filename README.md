# Possum Age Prediction

This project aims to predict the age of possums using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The model is built using the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and outlier removal.
3. **Model Training**: Training a Random Forest Regressor to predict the possum age.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R².
5. **Feature Importance**: Visualizing feature importances from the trained model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required dependencies using:
3. Run the notebook `project.ipynb` to execute the project.

## Results

The model performance is evaluated with:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score**
